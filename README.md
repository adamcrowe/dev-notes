#
> A programmer does not primarily write code; rather he primarily writes to another programmer about his problem solution. -- [Donald Knuth](http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Knuth_Don_X4100/PDF_index/k-9-pdf/k-9-u2769-1-Baker-What-Programmer-Does.pdf)

#
> Write self-explanatory code...the code and the documentation cannot be inconsistent if there is no documentation. -- [Robert L. Read](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)

#
> Code that's easier to read gets read more and therefore gets more scrutiny. Because of that, if there are bugs, they're more likely to be found. -- [Gordon Zhu](https://watchandcode.com/courses/77710/lectures/2001287)

#
> Deleted code is debugged code. -- [Jeff Sickel](http://www.defprogramming.com/quotes-by/jeff-sickel/)

#
> A program should follow the 'Law of Least Astonishment'. What is this law? It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the way that astonishes him least.  -- [The Tao Of Programming](http://canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html)

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. -- [Jamie Zawinski](http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247)

> It has taken us some time to dare to believe in our own results. It now seems to us, although we are aware that at this point we do not have sufficient data, and so it must remain a speculation, that what distinguishes the three groups in the first test is their different attitudes to meaninglessness. Formal logical proofs, and therefore programs – formal logical proofs that particular computations are possible, expressed in a formal system called a programming language – are utterly meaningless. To write a computer program you have to come to terms with this, to accept that whatever you might want the program to mean, the machine will blindly follow its meaningless rules and come to some meaningless conclusion. In the test the consistent group showed a pre-acceptance of this fact: they are capable of seeing mathematical calculation problems in terms of rules, and can follow those rules wheresoever they may lead. The inconsistent group, on the other hand, looks for meaning where it is not. The blank group knows that it is looking at meaninglessness, and refuses to deal with it. -- [Saeed Dehnadi and Richard Bornat](http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf)
