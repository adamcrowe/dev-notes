// * null is the absence of a value. It is an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable as a representation of 'no-value'.

// * undefined is the absence of a definition. It is used as the default value for uninitialized variables, function arguments that were not provided, and missing properties of objects. Functions return undefined when nothing has been explicitly returned.
