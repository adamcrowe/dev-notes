# SETUP
* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)
    * `npx create-react-app my-app --template redux`
    * [TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)
    * [React Router](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-router)
    * [React Bootstrap](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap)
    * [Deployment (GitHub, AWS, Firebase)](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment)

# UTILITIES
## Routing
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router)

## State Management
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org)
* [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org)
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
    * `const store = createStore(rootReducers, applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware, logger))`
    * Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function (e.g. an async API call) instead of an action (e.g., a plain object)
* [Logger for Redux](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger)
* [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)

## UI Components
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)

## Forms
* [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik)

## Debugging
* [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
    * To view performance metrics for your react app: Append ```?react_perf``` to your local server URL (e.g. localhost:3000/?react_perf)
    * Puts your console on blast when React is making unnecessary updates <https://github.com/maicki/why-did-you-update>


## ARCHITECTURE
# [Presentational and Container Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
> Youâ€™ll find your components much easier to reuse and reason about if you divide them into two categories. I call them Container and Presentational components* but I also heard Fat and Skinny, Smart and Dumb, Stateful and Pure, Screens and Components, etc.

|                   | Presentational Components (Stateless)         | Container Components (Stateful)                |
| ------------------| ----------------------------------------------| -----------------------------------------------|
| Purpose           | How things look (markup, styles)              | How things work (data fetching, state updates) |
| Aware of Redux    | No                                            | Yes                                            |
| To read data	    | Read data from props                          | Subscribe to Redux state                       |
| To change data	| Invoke callbacks from props                   | Dispatch Redux actions                         |
| Are written	    | By hand	                                    | Usually generated by React Redux               |
