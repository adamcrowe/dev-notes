> "A library is something that you call from your code, and a framework is something that calls your code."
* [A Framework Author's Case Against Frameworks - "Patterns, not frameworks."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7n2xnOiWI8)

> The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

> A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it. The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.
