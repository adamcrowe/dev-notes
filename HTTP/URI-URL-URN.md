# URI, URL, URN
> Uniform Resource Identifier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier>

> A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

> A URL is a type of URI that identifies a resource via a representation of its primary access mechanism (its network "location" e.g. http:// or ftp://), rather than by some other attributes it may have.

> A URN (Uniform Resource Name) is a URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace. A URN may be used to talk about a resource without implying its location or how to access it. For example, in the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. However, it gives no information as to where to find a copy of that book.

> A URN may be compared to a person's name, while a URL may be compared to his or her street address. In other words, a URN identifies an item and a URL provides a method for finding it.

> All URNs and URLs are URIs, but the opposite is not true. The part that makes something a URL is the combination of the name and an access method.

> "URI" is best used when you'’'re referring to a resource just by its name or some other fragment. And when you'’'re giving both the name of a resource and the method of accessing it (like a full URL), it'’'s best to call that a "URL".
