# Getting Project Ideas
> Copy until you can create. While you're practicing, don't bother with original ideas. Just copy something and focus on perfecting your technique!
> If you only practice through original ideas, this will be your workflow.
* Thinking of something
* Research
* Planning
* Marketing
* Design
* Development (The very last step)
> Looks pretty wasteful to me, unless you're running a startup company.
> For the ones who just want to code, consider this process instead.
* Code an existing app that interests you
> That's it! The process is now aligned with our goals. Instead of developing at the very end, we're now developing all the way through.
