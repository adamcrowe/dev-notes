# JOINS
## CROSS JOIN
* Combine all rows from both tables
## INNER JOIN
* CROSS JOIN then filter out rows that do not satisfy the `ON` joining condition
## LEFT OUTER JOIN
* INNER JOIN then add in any missing rows from the left table (the FROM table)
## RIGHT OUTER JOIN
* INNER JOIN then add in any missing rows from the right table (the JOIN table)
