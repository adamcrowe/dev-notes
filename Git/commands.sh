# SEQUENCE: REVERSE A COMMIT ON LOCAL COPY OF MASTER
# assuming you've just made an errant commit on master:
# "back up" your commit, creating a topic branch
git branch fix-spelling-error 			# then:
git reset --hard upstream/master 		# reset your master branch to the same state as upstream/master
git reset --hard origin/master 			# reset your master branch to the same state as upstream/master

# SEQUENCE: MERGE/PULL REQUESTS
git push origin master:temporary_branch # push local master to new branch (e.g. for pull request)

# REVERTING VS RESETTING
# `git revert` undoes a single commit
# `git revert` does not "revert" back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits
# `git revert` should be used to undo changes on a public branch (e.g. `git revert -n HEAD`)

# `git reset HEAD` undoes uncommitted changes
# `git reset should be reserved for undoing changes on a private branch
# Never use `git reset <commit-hash>` when any snapshots after <commit-hash> have been pushed to a public repository
# After publishing a commit, you have to assume that other developers are reliant upon it.

git revert <commit-hash> 	                # creates and applies a new reversed/(undo changes) commit to leave previous commit in history
git revert HEAD 		                # revert to before the most recent commit
git revert -n HEAD 		                # revert to before the most recent commit
git reset 				                # unstages all files without overwriting any changes (only use to undo local changes on a private branch)
git reset <file-name> 	                # remove file from staging area but leave pwd unchanged
git reset --hard 		                # reset staging area to most recent commit and overwrite/obliterate all changes to pwd
git reset <commit-hash> 		                # reset staging area to most recent commit leaving pwd alone - files can be re-committed
git reset HEAD 			                # reset staging area to most recent commit leaving pwd alone - files can be re-committed
git reset --hard HEAD 	                # unstage and throw away all changes in pwd
git reset --hard HEAD^ 	                # unstage and throw away all changes in pwd and go back to previous commit
git reset --mixed HEAD 	                # unstage all changes but leave them in pwd
git clean -df 			                # remove untracked files and untracked directories from pwd
git clean -xf 			                # remove untracked files from the pwd as well as any files usually ignored
git clean -n 			                # show which files would be removed from pwd
git clean -f 			                # execute clean (f = force check: will not remove untracked folders or files specified by .gitignore)
git clean -f <path> 	                # remove untracked files, but limit the operation to the specified path
--hard                                  # discard both staging area and working tree changes

# SEQUENCE: RETURN THE WORKING DIRECTORY TO THE EXACT STATE OF THE MOST RECENT COMMIT
git reset --hard 		                # reset staging area to most recent commit and *overwrite/obliterate* all changes to pwd
git clean -df 			                # remove untracked files and untracked directories)

# SEQUENCE: CHERRY-PICKING A COMMIT
# <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow>

git log 					            # find hash of commit
git checkout <branch-name> 		            # switch to branch to apply cherry-picked commit to
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>	            # apply cherry-picked commit to branch
							            # multiples: git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>

# THE REBASING PROCESS
# > Rebasing works by transferring each local commit to the updated master branch one at a time. This means that you catch merge conflicts on a commit-by-commit basis rather than resolving all of them in one massive merge commit. This keeps your commits as focused as possible and makes for a clean project history. In turn, this makes it much easier to figure out where bugs were introduced and, if necessary, to roll back changes with minimal impact on the project.

# > If Alice and Bob are working on unrelated features, it's unlikely that the rebasing process will generate conflicts. But if it does, Git will pause the rebase at the current commit and output the following message, along with some relevant instructions: `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <some-file>`

# > The great thing about Git is that anyone can resolve their own merge conflicts. In our example, Alice would simply run a `git status` to see where the problem is. Conflicted files will appear in the Unmerged paths section:
# Unmerged paths:
# (use "git reset HEAD <some-file>..." to unstage)
# (use "git add/rm <some-file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
#
# both modified: <some-file>

# > Then, Alice will edit the file(s) to her liking. Once she's happy with the result, she can stage the file(s) in the usual fashion and let git rebase do the rest:
# git add <some-file>
# git rebase --continue

# > And that's all there is to it. Git will move on to the next commit and repeat the process for any other commits that generate conflicts. If you get to this point and realize and you have no idea what's going on, don't panic. Just execute the following command and you'll be right back to where you started before you ran.
# git rebase --abort				# abort rebasing to start over
# git pull --rebase origin master 	# pull from master and rebase our changes at HEAD of master

# > After Alice has finished synchronizing with the central repository, she will be able to publish her changes successfully:
# git push origin master

# SEQUENCE: REBASE BRANCH
git checkout new-feature			# switch to feature branch
git rebase master 					# move new-feature to the HEAD of master
git checkout master 				# pull latest master
git merge new-feature				# fast-forward merge from master
git push origin master 				# push merged feature branch
