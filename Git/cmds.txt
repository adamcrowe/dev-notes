TODO (Copy cmds from old dev file) 

// reverse a commit on local copy of master
# assuming you've just made an errant commit on master: 
# "backs up" your commit, creating a topic branch 
git branch fix-spelling-error 
# reset your master branch to the same state as upstream/master 
git reset --hard upstream/master

// pull requests
# push local master to new branch (e.g. for pull request) 
git push origin master:temporary_branch

// stashing
# (does not stash new files or folders) 
# (only uncommited changes to files previously added will be stashed) 
git stash save “Description of my changes”
# get latest stash 
git stash pop
