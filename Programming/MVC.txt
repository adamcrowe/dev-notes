! Model
> Model code reflects real-world things. In a todo app, the Model would define what a “task” is and that a “list” is a collection of tasks.  

! View 
> View code is made up of all the functions that directly interact with the user. In a todo app, the View code will define what the todos and lists looks like, visually. 

! Controller
> Controller code acts as a liaison between the Model and the View, receiving user input and deciding what to do with it. In a todo app, the Controller could define how a user adds a task, or marks another as complete. The Controller connects the View’s "add" button to the Model, so that when you click “add task,” the Model adds a new task.

! Best Practices
* Fat Models, Kinny Controllers
