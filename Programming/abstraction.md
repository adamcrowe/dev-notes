# The Rule of Three
> When reusing code, copy it once, and only abstract the third time. This is the rule of three.

> Bad abstractions are hard to extend. They’re either too specific, because they were written without enough known use cases, or needlessly generic in an attempt to cover too many possible use cases.

[Wait for at least three or four instances of code duplication so that you can more clearly see the general case from which to write the abstract form.]

> Let’s be real. We’re talking about allowing code duplication in the service of avoiding bigger problems. There are consequences:
* Practicing the rule is difficult, and feels kind of like letting fields lie fallow
* There is a reason for the “don’t repeat yourself rule”: copying code adds a maintenance burden
> Despite these consequences, the rule of three is one of the great mind hacks that programmers can use to avoid doing unnecessary work and to produce better abstractions, leading to more software of higher quality delivered on time. That is, if you can accept a little duplication.
