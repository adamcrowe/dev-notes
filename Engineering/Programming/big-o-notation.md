## Explain Big-O notation in the simplest terms.
* Big-O notation tells how fast an algorithm is. This is very important when evaluating whether to use other people's algorithms or your own.
* Big-O notation, also known as Landau's symbol, tells us how the runtime or space requirement of a function grows as the input grows.
    * An algorithm's speed isn't measured in seconds but in the growth of the number of operations.
