## What is the data structure of the DOM?
* Tree

## What is a Stack? What is a Queue?
* A Stack follows the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) paradigm: the last element added will be removed first
** Add element: `array.push()`
** Remove (last) element: `array.pop()`
* A Queue follows the First-In First-Out (FIFO) paradigm: the first element added will be removed first
** Add element: `array.push()`
** Remove (first) element: `array.shift()`
