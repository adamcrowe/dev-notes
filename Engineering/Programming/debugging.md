> Good questions save time. Bad questions waste time. ~ Gordon Zhu

## 1. Understand the code

* Check all systems are running
* Pull down the latest code
* Diff local changes
* Check code for typos
* Read the error messages if you have them
* Step through the code line-by-line and figure out what each line does

## 2. Investigate the problem

* For 30 mins...
* Rubberducking: Draft a request for help using the following format:

## 3. Draft a help request

* Explain the full context of the problem:

    * I've tried ____, ____, and ____. and I've looked at ____ and ____.
    * Here is the relevant code:

* Isolate the code that illustrates the problem
* Make sure the code behaves exactly as you describe
* Explain the exact steps you took to reproduce the problem
* Explain what you expect to see and what you actually see
* Explain your assumptions and the tests you ran to confirm the problem
* Proofread your question and code extract; edit for brevity and clarity
* If 30 mins have passed...

## 4. Send a help request

* Ask for help, then...
* If the problem is solved before anyone responds, tell everyone you've asked
* Thank each person that helped you to investigate and fix the problem
