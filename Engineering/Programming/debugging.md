# DEBUGGING AND ASKING QUESTIONS

> Good questions save time. Bad questions waste time. ~ Gordon Zhu

## 1. Understand the code to the best of your ability

- Check all systems are running
- Diff changes to the code
- Check the code for typos
- Debug: Go through the code line-by-line and figure out what each line does

## 2. Investigate the problem

- Create a list of hypotheses about the problem and then test each methodically
- Rubberducking: Explain to yourself what you're doing to test each hypothesis

## 3. Prepare to ask for help

- (Write out your question even if you're going to ask colleague verbally)
- Explain the context of the problem
- Isolate the code that illustrates the problem
- Make sure the code behaves exactly as you describe
- Explain the exact steps you took to reproduce the problem
- Explain what you expect to see and what you actually see
- Explain your assumptions and the tests you ran to fix the problem
- Proofread your question and edit for brevity and clarity

## 4. Ask your question

- Then...
- If you find an answer before anyone responds, tell everyone you've asked
- Thank each person that helped you to investigate and fix the problem
