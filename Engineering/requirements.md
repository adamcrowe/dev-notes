# Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements
* Functional requirements define what the system does or must not do.
* Non-functional requirements specify how the system should do it.

## Functional
* Functional requirements are product features and focus on user requirements.
* Functional requirements usually define IF/THEN behaviours and include calculations, data input, and business processes.
* Functional requirements are features that allow the system to function as it was intended. Put another way, if the functional requirements are not met, the system will not work.

### Gathering Functional Requirements
* Consider the following stakeholder requirements:
** Business: The ultimate goal (order system, online catalogue, physical product - also approval workflows and authorization levels).
** Administration: The routine things the system will do such as monitoring and reporting.
** User: What the user of the system can do (place an order or browse the catalogue.)
** System: Software and hardware specifications, system responses, or system actions.

## Non-Functional
* Non-functional requirements are product properties and focus on user expectations.
* Non-functional requirements do not affect the basic functionality of the system (hence the name).
* Even if the non-functional requirements are not met, the system will still perform its basic purpose.

### Gathering Non-Functional Requirements
* TODO
