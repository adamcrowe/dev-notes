# Kanban
> Kanban exists because humans struggle to visualize progress and conceptualize long task lists, which translates to poor prioritization. ~ Viputheshwar Sitaraman

# 6 Kanban Principles
1. **Visualize the workflow**: Visualization of the Kanban board will help to identify issues easily and fix them
2. **WIP (work in progress) limits**: Set task limits in order to increase productivity
3. **Manage the agile workflow**: Observe what works and what doesn’t then optimize the workflow based on what works in order to ramp up kanban software delivery
4. **Adhere to the process rules**: Team adheres to the agile workflow rules and guidelines bringing everybody on the same page and enable them to produce quality work
5. **Feedback loops**: Typically expressed in daily meetings (similar to the Scrum stand-ups), the team gathers to assess the current situation and makes further work-process improvements
6. **Continuous improvement and delivery**: With constant improvements the team can speed up the kanban work process and thus continuously deliver pieces of software to the market

* Three swimlanes:
    * **Blockers**: issues that are slowing down the kanban work process
    * **Issues & Bugs**: bugs that should be fixed but aren’t urgent
    * **Someday**: irrelevant issues that can be fixed down the line
* Three columns:
    * **To Do**
    * **WIP (Work in Progress)**
    * **Done**
* Limit number of tasks that are "in progress"
* Close one item fully before moving to the next
* Daily stand-ups and retrospectives are optional
    * What did I complete yesterday?
    * What did I complete yesterday?
    * What did I complete yesterday?

## Kanban vs. Scrum
### Team
> If the work you're doing requires a team to collaborate to get things done, Scrum is an excellent fit. If it's a collection of people doing the work with one person completing their part in isolation before handling it off to the next person, some aspects of Scrum are going to feel out of step because you are not a team as scrum defines it. In the case Kanban will help these individuals manage handoffs and potentially uncover opportunities for people to improve how work flows between them. ~ Steve Porter, Scrum.org

* Scrum fosters a more structured working environment. It helps your team to be on the same page and work faster.
* Scrum is more suitable for non-mature teams as it follows strict guidelines and rules. Novices and newcomers need accountability. And Scrum offers exactly that.
* Scrum is great when time is of the essence. Because of the timeboxes, there is a sense of urgency developed in the team that keeps the scrum team members on their toes and makes them work zealously.
* Kanban, on the other hand, offers greater flexibility and less pressure. It enables you to make iterations to the workflow along the way without having you to worry about timeboxes and meeting deadlines.
* Kanban is better suited for mature teams. Teams familiar with the organization’s culture. Teams that have been developing for quite a while. And more importantly, teams that are highly skilled and accountable. * That’s because experienced teams have already developed reliable working habits and wouldn’t need to adhere to as rigid rules and guidelines as novices need.
* Both Kanban and Scrum are better suited for smaller teams. That’s because there’s a lack of documentation. And it’s extremely difficult to manage a big team that must adhere to constant changes.

### Planning
> In Kanban, you kind of feel like there's an endless amount of work happening (which is daunting). In Scrum, because of the sprint planning, it feels like you come to the end of a project which is gratifying. ~ William, Product Manager
* With the Scrum framework, you do some planning at the beginning of every sprint. Planning helps you to set clear and specific targets for the sprint.
* It also brings everybody on the same page. So, you’ll be able to ramp up the scrum software delivery process.
* Because of Scrum's detailed documentation, you can also come up with relatively accurate scrum release date and cost estimates.
* With Kanban, there’s close to zero planning involved.
