# Scrum Methodology
> Scrum exists because humans are very poor at estimating the amount of time any given task takes. ~ Viputheshwar Sitaraman

* Scrum adheres to the 12 principles of the Agile methodology. See: [Agile Manifesto](agile-manifesto.md)
* The Agile Scrum SDLC Model features timeboxes, or also known as sprints. Throughout the sprint, documentation is created, the scrum software is developed, and work processes are monitored and then improved.
* Each sprint lasts between two and four weeks. In that time, the team is working on delivering working software. Once the software is finished, it is deployed to the market and feedback is collected.
* Team roles are also vital when utilizing the Scrum framework. You have a product owner, a scrum master, as well as a scrum team. (See detail below)
* The product backlog is the place where all software features are noted down.
* The scrum master refers to the product backlog in order to create the scrum backlog.
* The scrum backlog consists of tasks and user stories needed to be completed in order to bring those features to life.
* A user story shows the product you are trying to develop through the eyes of your user. It basically illustrates the steps the user needs to take to finish a task within your software successfully.

## Benefits of Using Scrum
* One of the biggest advantages of using Scrum is that it allows you to bring everybody on the same page through daily Scrum meetings.
* It also enables you to come up with relatively precise time and cost estimates as there is some documentation involved at the start of each sprint.
* Another big advantage of the Scrum framework is the empirical process of having quick feedback causing the ability to deliver value.

## Disadvantages of Using Scrum
* Iterations aren't recommended during the sprint.
* When more tasks are added to the sprint, “Scope creep” happens. Scope creep can mess up your workflow by deprioritizing your tasks. And also cause you to miss deadlines.
* Team members should also be very skilled and held accountable. If there's a lack of accountability, your team will fall behind seriously as there is no management involved.
* Compared to Waterfall, Scrum lacks a long-term vision of the product because thorough research isn't common practice in Agile. Scrum only involves planning at the beginning of each sprint.

## Process
* Sprint Retrospective
* Sprint Review/Demo
* Iterations/Sprints (to Done)
* Daily Scrum/Standup
    * What did I do yesterday?
    * What will I do today?
    * Are there any blockers?
* Sprint Backlog
* Product/Team Backlog
* Definitions of Done
* Definition of Ready
    * Backlog Refinement
    * Sprint Planning
* Scrum Master (Quality)
* Dev Team (How and When)
* Product Owner (What and Why)
    * User stories
* Scrum Boards
    * User Story
    * To Do
    * In progress
    * Test
    * Done

## Roles
* There are three leading roles in the Scrum methodology. There is a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and a Scrum team.

### Product Owner
* The Product Owner communicates with the stakeholders and the customers to come up with a great product.
* Then, the Product Owner creates the product backlog. That's the place where all the features that need to be developed are listed.

### Scrum Master
* The Scrum Master then takes a look at the product backlog and creates the scrum backlog.
* In the scrum backlog, each feature is broken down into smaller tasks that need to be completed throughout the sprint. Those tasks are called user stories.
* User stories typically show you how the product looks through the eyes of the customer. And what steps the customer needs to take in order to complete a particular task.
* It's important to note that the Scrum Master isn't a manager. Every member of the Scrum team is responsible for its tasks and needs to make sure that he is meeting the product requirements.
* The Scrum Master makes sure that the team has the skills required to finish the project successfully. He should remove any hurdles to progress. He must also ensure that there's a pleasant work environment.

### Scrum Team
* The Scrum Team is cross-functional. Because everyone is responsible for its own assignments, each member of the team should be highly experienced.
* Team commitment is also absolutely essential as there will be changes along the way.
* The Scrum Team also does daily Scrum meetings. It's the time and place where everybody shares what they did yesterday, what they are going to do today, and if they are facing any challenges.
* Each scrum meeting lasts between 5–15 minutes.

## Standups
* There are daily Scrum "standup" meetings to help the team be on the same page.
* During these meetings, everyone shares what they did yesterday, what they are going to work on today, and if there are any challenges along the way.
* When using the Scrum model, team communication is on a pedestal. It's super important for the team to understand clearly the tasks they are working on and the progress that is being made.
* That will help the team move toward the goal line without stumbling on many roadblocks along the way.
* With burndown charts, the Scrum Master can track the team progress and initiate “speed” encouragement if needed.

## Sprint Review
* Once the sprint is over, there is a Scrum Review meeting where the work completed so far is discussed.
* The Scrum team then looks back at the development process and improves it based on what went right and what went wrong.
* The Scrum team also uses burndown charts to track progress.
