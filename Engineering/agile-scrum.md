# Scrum Methodology
* Scrum adheres to the 12 principles of the Agile methodology. See: [Agile Manifesto](agile-manifesto.md)

## Summary
> The Scrum framework operates in timeboxes called sprints. Each sprint lasts between two and four weeks. In that time, the team is working on delivering working software. Once the software is finished, it is deployed to the market and feedback is collected.
* Retrospective
* Sprint Review/Demo
* Iterations/Sprints (to Done)
* Daily Scrum/Standup
    * "What did I do yesterday?"
    * "What will I do today?"
    * "Are there any blockers?"
* Sprint Backlog
* Product/Team Backlog
* Definitions of Done (All)
* Definition of Ready (All)
    * Backlog Refinement
    * Sprint Planning (All)
* Scrum Master (Quality)
* Dev Team (How and When)
* Product Owner (What and Why)
    * User stories

## Roles
* There are three leading roles in the Scrum methodology. There is a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and a Scrum team.

### Product Owner
* The Product Owner communicates with the stakeholders and the customers to come up with a great product.
* Then, the Product Owner creates the product backlog. That’s the place where all the features that need to be developed are listed.

### Scrum Master
* The Scrum Master then takes a look at the product backlog and creates the scrum backlog.
* In the scrum backlog, each feature is broken down into smaller tasks that need to be completed throughout the sprint. Those tasks are called user stories.
* User stories typically show you how the product looks through the eyes of the customer. And what steps the customer needs to take in order to complete a particular task.
* It’s important to note that the Scrum Master isn’t a manager. Every member of the Scrum team is responsible for its tasks and needs to make sure that he is meeting the product requirements.

### Scrum Team
* The Scrum team is cross-functional. Because everyone is responsible for its own assignments, each member of the team should be highly experienced. Team commitment is also absolutely essential as there will be changes along the way.
* The Scrum team also does daily Scrum meetings. It’s the time and place where everybody shares what they did yesterday, what they are going to do today, and if they are facing any challenges. Thus, if someone is falling behind, the others can bring him back on track.
* Each scrum meeting lasts between 5–15 minutes.

## Sprint Review
* Once the sprint is over, there is a Scrum Review meeting where the work completed so far is discussed. The Scrum team then looks back at the development process and improves it based on what went right and what went wrong.
* The Scrum team also uses burndown charts to track progress.
