# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
> The software development life cycle is about producing high-quality software promptly.

## 7 Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
1. Planning
2. Requirements Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation/Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance/Improvement

### Planning
* Conduct thorough research on the product.
* Discuss plans with clients and all stakeholders.
* Identify the pros and cons of the current SDLC methodologies.
* Review customer's feedback via surveys, interviews, questionnaires, quizzes.
* Identify the *real* – and often unarticulated – customer needs.

### Requirements Analysis
* Create a SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document to describe all the product's functional features.
* Present the SRS document to stakeholders so they can either accept it or reject it (time and financial constraints).

### Design
* Create the DDS (Design Document Specification) to thoroughly define the features including budget and time estimates.
* Present DDS for client and stakeholder approval.

### Implementation/Development
* Develop product based on the DDS, selecting the most appropriate coding language.
* Continually communicate with the QA testers, product managers and DevOp engineers.

### Testing
* Test the codebase in order to find bugs, errors, oversights and ommissions.
* If issues, report them to the developers. Repeat until the QA/AT is passed.

### Deployment
* Deploy the product to

### Maintenance and improvement
* Create change and feature requests based on customer and user feedback.
