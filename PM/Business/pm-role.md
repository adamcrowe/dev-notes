# Product Manager
> The big value a PM provides is being a strong customer advocate. &mdash; [Sean Gabriel, Program Manager at Microsoft](https://thepmhandbook.com)

> The product manager is NOT the ideas person. Your job is to gather ideas from everyone and decide what to build and when to built it, given all the things that are happening inside the company and in the market. &mdash; [Cole Mercer, Become a Product Manager](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-product-manager-learn-the-skills-get-a-job)

Ideas come from:
* **Employees**: Co-workers, managment, yourself
* **Metrics**: Problems and inefficiencies revealed by user behaviour
* **Users/Customers/Clients**: User feedback (support tickets, emails, forums, social media, reviews)

## Starting a new job
### First week
1. Meet with boss to ask: what are the key metrics they're optimising; concerns/risks
2. Look at the data to understand past and present performance against key metrics
3. Schedule one-one-ones with every team member to ask: their goals and challenges
4. Read every internal document (epics, sales desks, presentations, release notes)
5. Arrange meeting with lead developer to ask biggest ongoing technical challenges
6. Start talking to users and spend time with sales and customer service teams

## Leadership
> If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. &mdash; [Antoine de Saint Exupéry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry)

> I firmly believe in the concept of the PM as the “servant leader” of the team. You’re given the mantel-piece to drive design and requirements, but at the end of the day you need to go convince other people who you are not the boss of to go do the things you want them to do. So every day, I look around me and ask, “Are people around me happy?” If they’re not, especially regarding the things in my control, I might not be doing my job well. Are my developers happy? Are my testers happy? Are my leads happy? If everyone seems like they don’t need me, then that’s an ideal situation. It means I’ve done a good enough job selling the idea to them, and they will just run with it and work it out. &mdash; [Sean Gabriel, Program Manager at Microsoft](https://thepmhandbook.com)
