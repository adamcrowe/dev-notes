# Iterative Planning
> The true job of an entrepreneur is systematically de-risking the business model over time. &mdash; [Ash Maurya: Lean Canvas Course](http://www.udemy.com/lean-canvas-course)

> As you're getting feedback, you're marking up the canvas and you're starting a new one. New experiments, new tests. Your "stack" of canvases is a chronicle of your startup over time. &mdash; [Steve Blank: Build. Measure. Learn. Lean Startup SXSW 2012.](https://www.udemy.com/course/lean-startup-sxsw-2012-videos-and-presentations)
1. Draft/redraft your plan starting with a rough guess
2. Identify the riskiest parts of your plan
    * **Product Risk**: Achieving product/market fit: _Problem_, _Solution_, _Unique Value Proposition_, _Cost Structure_, _Revenue Streams_
    * **Customer Risk**: Building a path to customers: _Customer Segments_, _Channels_, _Early Adopters_
    * **Market Risk**: Building a viable business: _Existing Alternatives_, _Key Metrics (Traction)_, _Cost Structure_, _Revenue Streams_, _Unfair Advantage_
3. Systematically test your plan with small batch experiments (See: [Tracking](tracking.md))
    * The expected outcome of the experiment must be declared upfront
    * The expected outcome of the experiment must be falsifiable: {Specific repeatable action} will achieve {Expected Measurable Action} within {Timeframe}
        * Example: Each blog post will drive 100+ signups within 10 days of publishing
    * Breakthrough insights are often hidden within failed experiments
4. Go to step 1.

# Three Stages of a Startup
> [A startup is] a search for a scalable, repeatable business model. &mdash; [Steve Blank, Four Steps to the Ephiphany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blank)
1. **Problem/Solution Fit**: Have we identified a problem worth solving?
2. **Product/Market Fit**: Have we built something people want?
3. **Scale**: How do we accelerate growth?

# MVP
> An MVP is the smallest solution that delivers customer value. (Bonus: And captures customer value.) &mdash; [Ash Maurya: Build. Measure. Learn. Lean Startup SXSW 2012.](https://www.udemy.com/course/lean-startup-sxsw-2012-videos-and-presentations)

> Whatever you think your MVP is it's probably an order of magnitude too much, so just cut the feature list in half, cut it in half again, and that's your MVP. &mdash; [Eric Ries: Build. Measure. Learn. Lean Startup SXSW 2012.](https://www.udemy.com/course/lean-startup-sxsw-2012-videos-and-presentations)

> The penalty of shipping too soon is nothing. The penalty of shipping too late is fatal. If customers don't like your product enough to complain to you about it, that means:
* You were able to find them (_Channels_, _Customer Segments_)
* Tell them about your product (_Problem_, _Solution_)
* Get them to try it (_Unique Value Proposition_)
* Care enough about the features that did or didn't have so much that they yelled at you (_Solution_)
> That's good news. Much more common is: ship the product and no-one cares; no-one even tries it; nothing happens at all. If nobody uses it, then the fact that it sucks doesn't matter; you don't have to apologise to anybody because nobody used it, so nobody even knows how bad it is - so you're completely safe. Take advantage of your total obscurity as an entrepreneur. Having a pathethically small number of customers is awesome: it's a huge asset, use it; it means you can personally apologise to every single customer you screw up. And for early adopters, being listened to is more important than having a good product; they love being listened to, that's at the heart of it...shipping early... I know it seems counter-intuitive but if you can just make yourself do it – just once – I guarantee you'll be cured of this fear for all time. &mdash; [Eric Ries: Build. Measure. Learn. Lean Startup SXSW 2012.](https://www.udemy.com/course/lean-startup-sxsw-2012-videos-and-presentations)

# Unique Value Proposition
> What's the difference that matters? &mdash; [Ash Maurya: Lean Canvas Course](http://www.udemy.com/lean-canvas-course)

## Instant Clarity Headline
Formula: End result customer wants {+ Specific period of time} {+ Address the objections}

### Examples
* "Hot fresh pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or it's free"
* "Get your dream job in 30 days"
* "Not more numbers but actionable metrics"

# Unfair Advantages (Moats)
> A real unfair advantage is something that cannot be easily copied or bought. &mdash; [Jason Cohen](http://blog.asmartbear.com/jason-cohen)
* Insider information
* Personal authority
* A dream team
* Existing customers
* The "right" celebrity endorsements
* Large network effects
* Community
* Organic search ranking
* Patents
* Culture

# Cost Structure + Revenue Streams
* **Cost**: What are customers paying (in time and money) for their current solution?
* **Revenue**: What will we charge for our solution?

# Traction?
> Traction is the rate at which a business model captures monetizable value from its users. &mdash; [Ash Maurya: Traction is the One Metric to Rule Them All](https://blog.leanstack.com/traction-is-the-one-metric-to-rule-them-all-6da55044a9e4)
* Monetizable value is not the same thing as revenue (value captured); revenue is an after-effect of value creation
* Monetizable value is found in those key activities users do that serve as leading indicators for future revenue
