> Will you actually use these numbers to help you make a decision? ... Stay focused on the metrics that are closely related to your goals to avoid unnecessary implementation effort and dashboard clutter. &mdash; [Kerry Rodden](https://library.gv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product-5f46359ab5be)
