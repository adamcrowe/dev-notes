# HEART Framework
Use the HEART Framework to define metrics that reflect the quality of the user experience and that map to your top goals

## HEART
Measure the quality of the user experience (ATEHR = Customer Journey order)
* **Happiness**: Measures of user attitudes, often collected via survey
    * e.g., Satisfaction; Perceived ease of use; Net-promoter score
* **Engagement**: Level of user involvement
    * e.g., Visits per user per week; Uploads per user per day
* **Adoption**: Gaining new users of a product or feature
    * e.g., Signups; Subscriptions; Purchases; Upgrades; Referrals
* **Retention**: The rate at which existing users are returning
    * e.g., Active users remaining present over time; Renewals (or Churn)
* **Task Success**: Efficiency, effectiveness, and error rate
    * e.g., Search result success; Time to upload; Profile creation complete

## GOALS, SIGNALS, METRICS
Identify what to implement and track (Goals, Signals, Metrics)
* **GOALS**: Identify a goal for each relevant HEART element (build a consensus about what the team cares about and where the business/product is headed)
* **SIGNALS**: Define the low-level changes in user behaviour or attitudes that are (or could be) the best indicators of success or failure for each goal
* **METRICS**: Refine the signals into metrics that can be tracked over time (e.g., average number of minutes spent watching videos per user per day)

|               | What should happen?   |  What to track?   | What to measure?  |
